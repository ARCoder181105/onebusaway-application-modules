# GTFS-RT Matching CPU Investigation — Findings & Ranked Fix List

**Date:** 2026-07-10
**Branch:** `perf/gtfsrt-matching-investigation`
**Status:** Evidence complete. This report is the deliverable; no matching-engine
code was changed this session.

## TL;DR

A production OBA box (2 GB RAM / 1 vCPU) with a single GTFS-realtime feed wired
(~840 trips, ~30 s poll) shows flat memory but CPU pegged near 85% of its one
core. A prior assessment called this "mostly legitimate work." We built a
repeatable harness that reproduces the poll path at King County Metro (KCM)
scale, captured a CPU flamegraph, an allocation profile, a wall-clock baseline,
and the bundle's stop-count distribution.

**Verdict:** the "mostly legitimate work" claim does **not** hold for the largest
cost we can see. The single dominant hotspot —
`BlockConfigurationEntryImpl$BlockStopTimeList.get()` — accounts for **19.78% of
CPU self-time** and **69.02% of all allocated bytes** (48.8 GB over a 100-refresh
run; `BlockStopTimeEntryImpl` is constructed *only* inside `.get()`, so its entire
allocation share is attributable to this call — of which the 59.20% / 41.8 GB
detailed in §4 is the block-location write-path slice), and it is pure, avoidable
waste: a materialize-on-access `List` view that
constructs a brand-new `BlockStopTimeEntryImpl` on **every** `.get()` call
instead of returning a cached reference. This is algorithmic/allocation waste,
not inherent load, and it is fixable behind an existing regression test.

**However** (stated up front, honestly): on *this* machine one feed's poll path
is ~203 ms of wall time, which at a real 30 s poll is only **~0.7% of one core**.
That does **not** by itself explain a production 85% peg. The waste is real and
worth fixing regardless, but reconciling it with the exact production figure
still needs two facts we did not have: the production **poll cadence** and the
**API read-path traffic** hitting the same box. See §2 and §6.

## 1. Setup

### Bundle (King County Metro, static GTFS)

| Stat | Value |
|---|---|
| Trips | 33,036 |
| Stops | 6,355 |
| Min stops/trip | 2 |
| Median stops/trip | 31 |
| Avg stops/trip | 32 |
| Max stops/trip | 97 |
| Trips with >50 stops | 5,011 (15.2%) |
| Trips with >100 stops | 0 |

Distribution is roughly bell-shaped, peaking at the 20–29-stop bucket (9,108
trips, 27.6%), with a tail to 90–99 (221 trips). Source: `StopCountHistogram`
run against the built KCM bundle (Task 7).

The KCM bundle (33,036 trips) is materially larger than the ~840-trip production
feed described in the ticket. This makes it a **stress** reproduction of the same
code paths, not a size-matched replica of the production box. It is well suited
to exposing per-trip constant factors and complexity class; it is **not** a
direct estimator of the production box's absolute CPU percentage.

### Feed (pinned GTFS-RT snapshot)

- Three KCM `.pb` feeds (trip updates, vehicle positions, alerts), downloaded
  once and pinned so matched counts don't drift run-to-run.
- **Matched records per refresh: 551.** This is the `CountingListener` count of
  `handleVehicleLocationRecord(s)` calls per `refresh()` — used throughout as the
  proxy for "matched vehicle updates per refresh."
  - **Caveat (transparency):** the `GtfsRealtimeSource` INFO log line at
    `GtfsRealtimeSource.java:785-791` (`"Agency … matched=… (unmatched)…"`) was
    **not** captured in any run log this investigation produced (grep for
    `matched=` / `Agency` across all scratchpad logs returned zero hits — most
    likely the harness logging config runs that class below INFO). So `records=551`
    is a *proxy* for the matched-trip-id count, not that exact log value. If the
    precise matched/unmatched split ever matters, it still needs to be captured.

### JVM / hardware / method

- **JVM:** OpenJDK 11, `-Xmx1500m` (deliberately approximating the 2 GB / 1 vCPU
  production box, leaving headroom for non-heap), G1GC.
- Profiling flags: `-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+DebugNonSafepoints` for
  accurate (non-safepoint-biased) stacks.
- **Hardware:** developer Mac (Apple silicon, macOS). A modern desktop-class
  core — **faster than a cloud 1-vCPU share.** This matters for §2.
- **Method:**
  1. Build the KCM bundle **once**, off to the side (slow, not measured).
  2. Stand up a real `GtfsRealtimeSource` with the full production collaborator
     set (real `VehicleStatusServiceImpl` as the `VehicleLocationListener` and
     occupancy listener, cancel service, alert service, feed `file://` URLs),
     via `PerfBundleHarness`.
  3. `setRefreshInterval(0)` so no background scheduler runs — the loop drives
     `refresh()` synchronously.
  4. **`source.reset()` before every measured `refresh()`** so the
     `_lastVehicleUpdate` dedup is cleared and **both** cost stages (matching +
     block-location write) run every iteration, faithful to production where the
     feed timestamp advances each poll. Confirmed: `records=551` on every logged
     iteration (0, 10, 20, … 90), not just iteration 0.
  5. Warm up 20 refreshes, measure 100. Profile the **measure phase only**
     (profiler started after warmup, stopped before teardown).
  6. async-profiler 3.0 (`event=cpu` and `event=alloc`) as primary; JDK JFR as an
     independently-verified fallback.

### Honesty / transparency gaps (stated plainly)

- **Matched/unmatched log line not captured** — `records=551` used as proxy
  (above).
- **No GC log was captured.** GC cost is *inferred* from G1 frames appearing
  directly in the CPU flat profile (§3), not measured from an `-Xlog:gc` capture.
- Whole-`refresh()` wall time is **not** pure matching — see §2.
- The `.get()`-call-count figure in §5 is an **order-of-magnitude estimate**
  (allocation bytes ÷ estimated object size), not an instrumented count.

Every inference below is labeled as an inference.

## 2. Baseline

Canonical run (`benchmark-run3.log`), and two corroborating profiled runs:

| Run | mean | p50 | p95 | throughput | records |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline (canonical) | 203.18 ms | 200.44 ms | 223.40 ms | 4.92 refresh/s | 551 |
| CPU-profiled | 199.07 ms | 197.47 ms | 214.56 ms | 5.02 refresh/s | 551 |
| Alloc-profiled | 193.43 ms | 189.78 ms | 206.86 ms | 5.17 refresh/s | 551 |
| JFR fallback | 221.04 ms | 211.65 ms | 242.79 ms | 4.52 refresh/s | 551 |

Take **~203 ms/refresh** as the headline. async-profiler overhead was negligible;
JFR's was ~10–20 ms/refresh higher, as expected.

**Important caveat on what 203 ms includes.** This is whole-`refresh()` wall time
— it covers matching **plus** the block-location write, the alert diff, and the
position cache write. It is **not** pure matching-engine time. In fact the CPU
attribution (§3) shows the majority of the hot self-time lands on the
block-location *write* path (`getBlockLocation`), not the trip-update matching
path. So "matching" in the loose sense the ticket used is really "the whole poll
path," and that's what 203 ms measures.

### Reconciliation with the production 85%-of-a-core symptom

At a real **30 s poll**, one `refresh()` of 203 ms is:

```
203 ms / 30,000 ms ≈ 0.68% of one core (on this Mac, over a 30 s window)
```

So on this machine, **one feed's poll path alone does not obviously peg a core** —
not even close. We should not overclaim that this reproduction "explains" the
production 85%. Candidate explanations for the gap, none yet confirmed:

1. **Slower cloud core.** A shared 1-vCPU cloud slice is materially slower than
   this desktop-class core. Even a 5–10× slowdown, though, only takes 0.68% to
   ~3–7% — still not 85%. (Inference.)
2. **Higher poll frequency.** If the production feed is actually polled far more
   often than 30 s (or multiple feeds/agencies are wired), the per-poll cost
   multiplies. The design doc's "~30 s" is an assumption worth verifying.
3. **API read-path / query load.** The same box serves arrivals-and-departures
   queries. `AbstractBlockLocationServiceImpl.getBlockLocation` — the #2 CPU
   hotspot here — is *also* on the read path, and it hammers the same
   `BlockStopTimeList.get()` hotspot. A busy read path could dominate CPU
   independently of polling. This is the **most likely** missing contributor and
   is only measured secondarily here. (Inference.)
4. **Other co-located app work** (bundle refresh, alert processing, logging).

**Recommendation:** before attributing the 85% to matching, confirm (a) the
production poll cadence and feed/agency count, and (b) the API read-traffic on
the box. Both are cheap to gather and would close the reconciliation. The fixes
in §7 are worth doing regardless, because the *waste itself* is real and measured
— but the exact 85% attribution is not yet proven and this report does not claim
it.

## 3. CPU attribution

Top ~15 self-time frames, async-profiler `flat`, 2,108 measure-phase samples
(Task 5):

| # | Self % | Samples | Frame |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **19.78%** | 417 | `BlockConfigurationEntryImpl$BlockStopTimeList.get` |
| 2 | 6.12% | 129 | `AbstractBlockLocationServiceImpl.getBlockLocation` |
| 3 | 6.02% | 127 | `java.lang.String.equals` |
| 4 | 4.08% | 86 | `G1ParScanThreadState::copy_to_survivor_space` (GC) |
| 5 | 2.94% | 62 | `java.lang.String.coder` |
| 6 | 2.75% | 58 | `BlockConfigurationEntryImpl$BlockStopTimeList.size` |
| 7 | 2.37% | 50 | `G1ScanEvacuatedObjClosure::do_oop_work` (GC) |
| 8 | 2.04% | 43 | `java.util.ArrayList.elementData` |
| 9 | 1.61% | 34 | `java.util.AbstractList$Itr.hasNext` |
| 10 | 1.57% | 33 | `PropertyPathExpression.<init>` |
| 11 | 1.47% | 31 | `java.util.Objects.checkIndex` |
| 12 | 1.33% | 28 | `java.util.HashMap.putVal` |
| 13 | 1.19% | 25 | `java.util.AbstractList$Itr.checkForComodification` |
| 14 | 1.19% | 25 | `G1ScanObjsDuringUpdateRSClosure::do_oop_work` (GC) |
| 15 | 1.19% | 25 | `java.util.ArrayList.get` |

Also relevant to the investigation's named targets:

- `PropertyPathExpression.invokeReturningFullResult` **1.00%** — reflection cost
  inside `MappingLibrary.mapToValue`'s index rebuild.
- `MappingLibrary.mapToValue` self-time only **0.33%** — its cost lives in callees
  (`PropertyPathExpression` / `HashMap`), not the method body.
- `GtfsRealtimeTripLibrary.applyTripUpdatesToRecord` self **0.24%**,
  `getBlockStopTimeForStopTimeUpdate` self **0.09%** — negligible *self*-time;
  both are thin dispatchers whose cost lives in what they call (chiefly
  `mapToValue` and `BlockStopTimeList.get()`).
- **Feed parsing is not a hotspot** — protobuf frames (`CodedInputStream`,
  `GeneratedMessageV3`, …) sum to well under 1% self-time combined.
- **`ScheduledBlockLocationServiceImpl` does not appear at all** in the CPU flat
  profile — it is not a measurable hotspot in this run.

### GC (inferred, not measured)

The three G1 frames above (#4, #7, #14) sum to **~7.64% self-time**. No `-Xlog:gc`
capture was taken, so this is the only GC evidence we have; it is consistent with
the ~706 MB/refresh allocation rate (§4) driving frequent young-gen collections.
**Inference**, flagged as such.

### Call-stack attribution (from `traces=15`)

Essentially all of the 15 hottest stacks (~34% of measure-phase CPU) funnel
through **one path** — the vehicle-position / block-location *write* path, not
the trip-update matching path:

```
GtfsRealtimeSource.refresh
  → handleUpdates → handleCombinedUpdates
    → VehicleStatusServiceImpl.handleVehicleLocationRecord
      → BlockLocationServiceImpl.handleVehicleLocationRecord
        → BlockLocationServiceImpl.putBlockLocationRecord
          → AbstractBlockLocationServiceImpl.getBlockLocation      <- 6.12% self, dispatch hub
            → BlockConfigurationEntryImpl$BlockStopTimeList.get     <- 19.78% self, THE hotspot
            → BlockStopTimeList.size                                <- 2.75% self
            → AgencyAndId.equals / String.equals / String.coder     <- ~9% self, ID matching
            → AbstractList$Itr.next / hasNext / checkForComodification
```

**Key finding:** `BlockStopTimeList.get(index)` is *not* a cheap array lookup. It
is called from inside an `AbstractList$Itr` traversal (once per element while
iterating a trip's stop-time list), and each call allocates a fresh
`BlockStopTimeEntryImpl` (see §4). It is reached from **both** the vehicle-position
write path (dominant) and the trip-update matching path.

## 4. Allocation attribution

Top allocation sites, async-profiler `alloc` flat, 134,977 measure-phase samples
(Task 5):

| # | % bytes | Bytes | Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **69.02%** | 48.8 GB | `BlockStopTimeEntryImpl` |
| 2 | 5.67% | 4.0 GB | `java.lang.Object[]` |
| 3 | 4.87% | 3.4 GB | `java.util.HashMap$Node` |
| 4 | 3.63% | 2.6 GB | `PropertyInvocationResult` |
| 5 | 2.88% | 2.0 GB | `byte[]` |
| 6 | 2.39% | 1.7 GB | `java.util.HashMap$Node[]` |
| 7 | 2.14% | 1.5 GB | `int[]` |
| 8 | 0.95% | 669 MB | `java.lang.String` |
| 9 | 0.62% | 437 MB | `java.util.regex.Pattern` |
| 10 | 0.53% | 375 MB | `com.google.protobuf.SmallSortedMap$1` |
| 11 | 0.52% | 369 MB | `java.util.regex.Matcher` |
| 12 | 0.38% | 271 MB | `TripUpdate$StopTimeEvent` |

Total allocated over the 100-refresh measure phase: **~70.6 GB** — i.e. **~706
MB/refresh**, of which **~489 MB/refresh is `BlockStopTimeEntryImpl` alone.**

### Where those allocations come from (`traces=10`)

- **59.20%** of *all* allocated bytes (41.8 GB): `BlockStopTimeEntryImpl`
  allocated inside `BlockStopTimeList.get()`, from
  `AbstractBlockLocationServiceImpl.getBlockLocation` (the vehicle-position write
  path). This **confirms** `.get()` manufactures a new object per call instead of
  returning a stored reference.
- **~14.7%** combined (three trace groups): same `BlockStopTimeEntryImpl` via
  `BlockStopTimeList.get()`, but reached from the **trip-update** path
  (`applyTripUpdatesToRecord → createVehicleLocationRecordForUpdate`). Same
  materialize-on-access list, walked from both ingestion paths.
- **4.97%** (3.5 GB): `HashMap$Node` from `MappingLibrary.mapToValue`'s internal
  `HashMap.put`, from `getBlockStopTimeForStopTimeUpdate` — this is exactly the
  **"index rebuilt on every stop-time update"** churn the investigation
  predicted. `mapToValue` builds and discards a fresh index `HashMap` on every
  stop-time update.
- **4.91%** (3.5 GB): `Object[]` boxing inside `PropertyMethodImpl.invoke` /
  `PropertyPathExpression.invokeReturningFullResult`, from the same `mapToValue`
  rebuild — reflection-based property access allocating a per-invocation args
  array.

So the allocation profile independently corroborates the CPU profile: **the
majority of both CPU and memory pressure traces to one root cause** — a
lazily-materializing list view (`BlockStopTimeList`) whose `.get()` rebuilds a
`BlockStopTimeEntryImpl` each call — plus a secondary, smaller churn source (the
per-stop-time-update `mapToValue` index rebuild).

### Why `.get()` reconstructs an object every call (grounded in source)

`BlockConfigurationEntryImpl.BlockStopTimeList` (an inner
`AbstractList<BlockStopTimeEntry>`) implements `get(int)` as:

```java
// BlockConfigurationEntryImpl.java:362-376
public BlockStopTimeEntry get(int index) {
  int tripIndex = tripIndices[index];
  BlockTripEntry blockTrip = trips.get(tripIndex);
  TripEntry trip = blockTrip.getTrip();
  List<StopTimeEntry> stopTimes = trip.getStopTimes();
  int stopTimeIndex = index - accumulatedStopTimeIndices[tripIndex];
  StopTimeEntry stopTime = stopTimes.get(stopTimeIndex);
  boolean hasNextStop = index + 1 < tripIndices.length;
  return new BlockStopTimeEntryImpl(stopTime, index, blockTrip, hasNextStop);  // <- new object every call
}
```

There is no cache. Every `.get(i)` — and every iterator step, since
`AbstractList`'s iterator calls `get(i)` — allocates a new `BlockStopTimeEntryImpl`
wrapping otherwise-immutable underlying data. Because the underlying arrays
(`tripIndices`, `accumulatedStopTimeIndices`, `trips`, per-trip `stopTimes`) are
fixed for the life of the bundle, these wrappers are effectively immutable and
could be built once and cached.

---

## 5. Quadratic-cost evidence

Two independent inner loops over a trip's stop times sit on the poll path, both in
`GtfsRealtimeTripLibrary.applyTripUpdatesToRecord`:

**(a) The `mapToValue` index rebuild** — `getBlockStopTimeForStopTimeUpdate`
(`GtfsRealtimeTripLibrary.java:1132`) calls
`MappingLibrary.mapToValue(stopTimes, "stopTime.gtfsSequence")`, building an
N-entry `HashMap` over **all** of the trip's stop times, and it is called **once
per stop-time update** from the loop at line 958. For a trip with N stop times and
N updates that is N map-builds × N entries = **O(N²)** map insertions per trip,
each insertion doing a reflective property read.

**(b) The `lastStopScheduleTime` inner rescan** — inside that same per-stop-time-
update loop (`GtfsRealtimeTripLibrary.java:964-970`), the code rescans **all** of
`blockTrip.getStopTimes()` to find the maximum arrival time, once per stop-time
update:

```java
// GtfsRealtimeTripLibrary.java:964-970 — runs once PER stopTimeUpdate
List<BlockStopTimeEntry> stopTimes = blockTrip.getStopTimes();
for (BlockStopTimeEntry bste : stopTimes) {
  long scheduleTime = instance.getServiceDate() + bste.getStopTime().getArrivalTime() * 1000;
  if (scheduleTime > lastStopScheduleTime) {
    lastStopScheduleTime = scheduleTime;
  }
}
```

`lastStopScheduleTime` here does **not** depend on the current `stopTimeUpdate` —
it is the trip's max schedule time, invariant across the inner loop — yet it is
recomputed on every iteration, and every iteration walks `blockTrip.getStopTimes()`
(a `BlockStopTimeList`, so every step allocates a `BlockStopTimeEntryImpl`). This
is a textbook O(stops²) rescan that could be hoisted to run once per block-trip.

### Correlating with the histogram

With median = 31 stops and max = 97:

- A typical trip's O(stops²) inner loop ≈ **31² ≈ 961 iterations**.
- The longest trips ≈ **97² ≈ 9,409 iterations**.
- 5,011 trips (15.2%) exceed 50 stops, so a meaningful slice of the bundle carries
  a per-refresh constant factor in the **thousands** of iterations, not tens.

### Order-of-magnitude cross-check (labeled: estimate, not measured)

`BlockStopTimeEntryImpl` holds two references + an `int` + a `boolean` → shallow
size ~32 bytes (compressed oops). At ~489 MB/refresh attributed to it, that's on
the order of **10–15 million `.get()`-driven allocations per refresh**. Against
551 matched records, that's ~18,000–27,000 `.get()` calls per matched vehicle —
one to two orders of magnitude above a single O(stops) pass (31) or even one full
O(stops²) self-scan (961) over a median trip. That gap is consistent with the same
trip's stop-time list being re-walked/re-materialized **multiple times per vehicle
per refresh** (across candidate deviations / repeated block entry), i.e. the cost
is driven by *both* a stop-count-dependent inner loop *and* redundant re-invocation
of it. **This 10–15M figure is an inference from bytes ÷ estimated object size, not
an instrumented count.**

**Does the O(stops²) hypothesis hold?** Yes, with evidence: two concrete O(stops)
inner loops nested inside a per-stop-time-update loop are present in source (a),(b);
the flamegraph puts ~20% self-time + majority of allocations in the per-element
`.get()` those loops hammer; and the histogram shows the stop counts that make the
quadratic term bite. The magnitude cross-check further suggests redundant
re-invocation on top of the quadratic term.

## 6. Verdict on "mostly legitimate work"

**Not accurate for the dominant cost.** The evidence:

- **~20% of CPU self-time** and **~69% of all allocated bytes** come from a single
  avoidable pattern — a materialize-on-access list view (`BlockStopTimeList`) that
  reconstructs a `BlockStopTimeEntryImpl` on every `.get()`, hammered by repeated
  stop-time iteration on both the block-location write path and the trip-update
  matching path.
- A second, smaller waste source (the per-stop-time-update `mapToValue` rebuild and
  its reflective property reads) adds several more percent of allocations.
- Neither is inherent to "matching 840 trips" — both are constant-factor /
  algorithmic overhead that a cache or a hoist removes without changing behavior.

So the majority of the *visible* CPU and the vast majority of allocation is
**waste, not load.**

**But be precise about scope.** Two honest qualifications:

1. The waste is proven; the production **85%** figure is **not** reproduced here.
   On this machine one 30 s poll is ~0.7% of a core (§2). The 85% almost certainly
   involves a slower cloud core and/or read-path query load and/or a faster poll
   cadence — factors this poll-path harness doesn't capture. Fixing the waste will
   reduce CPU and (especially) allocation/GC pressure, but we cannot yet promise
   "this fix takes you from 85% to X%" without the cadence + read-traffic data.
2. Because `getBlockLocation` (the #2 hotspot) is *also* the read-path entry point,
   the same fix very likely helps the API query path too — which, if reads are the
   real production driver, could matter more than the poll path. That's an argument
   *for* the fix, but it also means the production win should be **re-measured**,
   not extrapolated from this harness.

Bottom line: **the prior "mostly legitimate work" framing is wrong about the
biggest cost we can measure — it's mostly fixable waste — but confirming the
exact production impact still requires the poll-cadence and read-traffic facts
called out in §2.**

---

## 7. Ranked fix list

Ranked lowest cost/risk & highest reward first. Rewards tie to the measured
self-time / allocation percentages above; each is an **estimate** of the poll-path
CPU/allocation it removes and should be **re-measured** after implementation. The
harness makes that trivial: re-run `GtfsRtRefreshBenchmark` (same warmup/measure
loop) and diff the `BASELINE` line + re-capture the flamegraphs.

### Fix 1 — Cache/memoize `BlockStopTimeList.get()` (highest reward, do first)

- **What:** Stop reconstructing a `BlockStopTimeEntryImpl` on every `.get(index)`.
  The wrapped data (`tripIndices`, `accumulatedStopTimeIndices`, `trips`, per-trip
  `stopTimes`) is fixed for the bundle's lifetime, so the wrappers are effectively
  immutable. Build them once — lazily populate a `BlockStopTimeEntryImpl[]` (length
  `tripIndices.length`) on first access and return the cached element thereafter,
  or precompute the array when the `BlockConfigurationEntryImpl` is built.
- **Where:** `BlockConfigurationEntryImpl.java:361-376`
  (`BlockStopTimeList.get`), same file's `BlockStopTimeList` inner class.
- **Expected reward:** the largest single item — **~19.78% CPU self-time** and
  **~59% of all allocations (≈489 MB/refresh)** trace directly to this call.
  Removing the per-call allocation should also shrink the ~7.6% G1 GC self-time
  (inferred). Realistically the single highest-leverage change in the codebase for
  this workload.
- **Implementation cost:** **Low–medium.** A few lines in one inner class. Two
  care points: (1) memory — caching one wrapper per block-stop-time across all
  block configurations trades CPU/alloc for retained heap; measure retained size
  on a large bundle (KCM is a good stress case) to confirm it fits the 2 GB box.
  (2) `Serializable` — the list is `Serializable`; a cached array is fine but keep
  it `transient` + lazily rebuilt if bundle serialization must stay stable.
- **Regression risk:** **Low**, if the cached wrapper is byte-for-byte equivalent
  to the freshly-built one. `BlockStopTimeEntryImpl` wraps immutable inputs, so
  identity-vs-equality is the only behavioral subtlety — audit callers that might
  rely on `==` (none should).
- **Covering test:** `ScheduledBlockLocationServiceImplTest` (14 tests) exercises
  the block-location path that dominates `.get()` usage. The Task 6 golden
  `GtfsRealtimeTripLibraryCharacterizationTest` covers the trip-update path's use
  of it. **Coverage note:** neither test directly asserts `BlockStopTimeList`
  element *identity/equality* semantics; add a small targeted unit test on
  `BlockConfigurationEntryImpl.getStopTimes()` asserting `get(i).equals(...)`
  stability and correct values before/after the change.

### Fix 2 — Hoist the `mapToValue` sequence index out of the per-update loop

- **What:** `getBlockStopTimeForStopTimeUpdate` rebuilds
  `MappingLibrary.mapToValue(stopTimes, "stopTime.gtfsSequence")` on **every**
  stop-time update. The index depends only on the block-trip's stop times, not on
  the update, so build it **once per block-trip** and pass it in (or memoize per
  `blockTrip`).
- **Where:** `GtfsRealtimeTripLibrary.java:1132` (the `mapToValue` call), fed from
  the loop at `GtfsRealtimeTripLibrary.java:958`. Hoist the map construction to
  just above line 958 (once per `blockTrip`).
- **Expected reward:** **~5% of allocations** (the 4.97% `HashMap$Node` + part of
  the 4.91% reflective `Object[]` boxing both trace to this rebuild), plus the
  associated `PropertyPathExpression` reflection CPU (~1–2.5% self-time across
  frames #10, and `invokeReturningFullResult` 1.00%). Turns O(N²) map inserts per
  trip into O(N).
- **Implementation cost:** **Low.** Move one statement out of a loop; thread the
  map (or a per-`blockTrip` cache) through `getBlockStopTimeForStopTimeUpdate`'s
  signature.
- **Regression risk:** **Low.** Pure loop-invariant code motion; output identical.
- **Covering test:** Task 6 golden `GtfsRealtimeTripLibraryCharacterizationTest`
  snapshots the produced `VehicleLocationRecord` / predictions for exactly this
  method — it will catch any behavior drift. This is the best-covered fix.

### Fix 3 — Lift the O(stops) `lastStopScheduleTime` inner rescan

- **What:** The `lastStopScheduleTime` max-arrival rescan
  (`GtfsRealtimeTripLibrary.java:964-970`) runs once per stop-time update but is
  invariant across updates. Compute it **once per block-trip** (before the
  `stopTimeUpdate` loop at line 958), or precompute it from the trip's known last
  stop time.
- **Where:** `GtfsRealtimeTripLibrary.java:964-970`, hoist above line 958.
- **Expected reward:** **Modest but non-trivial.** Removes one full O(stops)
  `BlockStopTimeList` walk per stop-time update — and because that walk goes
  through `BlockStopTimeList.get()`, each removed iteration is also a removed
  `BlockStopTimeEntryImpl` allocation. Its reward **overlaps heavily with Fix 1**:
  if Fix 1 lands, `.get()` becomes allocation-free and this rescan gets much
  cheaper on its own, so do Fix 1 first, then re-measure before deciding how much
  Fix 3 still buys. Independently, it also eliminates redundant CPU work.
- **Implementation cost:** **Low.** Loop-invariant hoist.
- **Regression risk:** **Low–medium.** Must confirm `lastStopScheduleTime` is
  genuinely update-independent (it is, by inspection: it only reads
  `bste.getStopTime().getArrivalTime()` and the service date) and that nothing in
  the loop body mutates the stop-time list. Verify against the golden.
- **Covering test:** Task 6 golden `GtfsRealtimeTripLibraryCharacterizationTest`
  (same method under characterization).

### Fix 4 — Match only changed vehicles (dedup **before** match) — evaluate, don't assume

- **What:** Today `handleCombinedUpdates` runs
  `createVehicleLocationRecordForUpdate` for **all** ~feed updates
  (`GtfsRealtimeSource.java:711`) **before** the `_lastVehicleUpdate` timestamp
  dedup (`GtfsRealtimeSource.java:741`). So the full O(feed) match cost is paid
  every poll even when a given vehicle hasn't advanced. If semantics allow,
  dedup/skip unchanged vehicles *before* the expensive match.
- **Where:** `GtfsRealtimeSource.java:711` (match call) vs `:741` (dedup gate).
- **Expected reward:** **Potentially large but conditional** — in the steady state
  where few vehicles changed between polls, this avoids most matching work
  entirely. But in this pinned-snapshot harness, `reset()` forces every vehicle to
  look "changed" every iteration, so the harness **cannot currently quantify** this
  fix; its real-world reward depends on the production per-poll change rate (which
  ties back to the §2 cadence question).
- **Implementation cost:** **Medium.** Requires moving/duplicating the dedup key
  check earlier and reasoning about partial-feed and clock-skew cases.
- **Regression risk:** **Medium–high — the riskiest item.** The current ordering
  may be intentional: matching can have side effects (occupancy records, alerts,
  matched-stop bookkeeping via `MonitoredResult`) that would be skipped if we
  short-circuit before matching. Skipping unchanged vehicles could drop those
  updates or stale out predictions. **Do not ship without** confirming exactly
  what downstream state each pre-dedup match mutates.
- **Covering test:** **Coverage is thin here.** The unit-level golden covers a
  single record's transform, not the `handleCombinedUpdates` dedup ordering across
  a feed. This needs a new test at the `GtfsRealtimeSource.handleCombinedUpdates`
  level (or an integration test in `onebusaway-gtfsrt-integration-tests`) asserting
  that skipping unchanged vehicles preserves occupancy/alert/prediction side
  effects. Treat Fix 4 as a separate, later investigation — not a quick win.

### Recommended order

1. **Fix 1** (cache `.get()`) — highest reward, low risk, well-isolated. Re-measure.
2. **Fix 2** (hoist `mapToValue`) — cheap, best-covered, removes the secondary
   allocation source. Re-measure.
3. **Fix 3** (hoist `lastStopScheduleTime`) — cheap; re-measure *after* Fix 1 to
   see residual benefit.
4. **Fix 4** (pre-match dedup) — defer; needs semantic analysis + new tests +
   the production change-rate data before it can be justified or sized.

After each fix, re-run `GtfsRtRefreshBenchmark` and re-capture the CPU + alloc
flamegraphs to validate the actual (not estimated) delta, and run
`GtfsRealtimeTripLibraryCharacterizationTest` +
`ScheduledBlockLocationServiceImplTest` to prove behavior preservation.
